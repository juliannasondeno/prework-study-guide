        <ul>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheets contain CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External style sheets use a separate CSS file linked within the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space there is around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space there is around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A border surrounds the padding and its content and is on the inside of the margin.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain the property applied and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>The * symbol applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>A comma combines two selectors into a single CSS rule, so the declarations affect both selectors.</li>
          <li>The width, height, background-color, and color can be adjusted within the header and footer selectors.</li>
          <li>Semantic references and hexadecimal code, or hex #, both refer to and assign colors.</li>
          <li>The text-align rule is a positioning property that can adjust headings, paragraphs, and lists.</li>
          <li>The img selector assigns property values to any image element.</li>
          <li>The display property assigned with the block value assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>The height, width, margin-left, and margin-right can be adjusted within the img selector.</li>
          <li>The padding and font size rule can adjust paragraphs and lists.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow property adds shadow effects around an elements frame and defines the width of the shadow on the x and y axis.</li>
          <li>A period preceding a word designates a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class will gain those CSS properties.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>A string variable is a sequence of characters used to represent text contained within quotation marks.</li>
          <li>A Boolean variable is a logical data type that can only have the values true or false.</li>
          <li>An array stores multiple values under a single variable name by attaching a number, or index, to each item starting at 0.
          <li>An array can contain different types of data such as string variables, number variables, and Boolean variables.</li>
          <li>A semicolon is used to end a statement and curly brackets surround code that will be executed.</li>
          <li>The assignment operator, = , assigns a value to a variable.</li>
          <li>The strictly equal operator, === , checks to see if two values are equal and returns a Boolean result.</li>
          <li>The console.log method logs the variable to the web console in the browser.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a type of conditional that executes a block of code if the condition is true.</li>
          <li>An else if statement allows for more than one condition.</li>
          <li>A for loop is used to repeat a single block of code by using the pattern of index numbers to perform a task on all items in an array.</li>
          <li>The let keyword declares a variable and allows the value to be reassigned.</li>
          <li>A for loop begins with the for keyword, contains a three part conditional statement, and a code block that defines what will be repeated.</li>
          <li>The three part conditional statement in a for loop contains a starting point, a condition, and a pattern.</li>
          <li>The starting point declares a variable and its value; to start at the beginning of the array, set the value to zero.</li>
          <li>The condition uses the length property, variablename.length, to state that the variable must be less than the length of the array.</li>
          <li>The pattern allows the array to repeat over each item; x+1 or x++ increases the variable by one .  </li>
          <li>A function is a reusable block of code that contains instructions on how to perform a specific task.</li>
          <li>A function must be declared and called in order to be executed.</li>
          <li>To declare a function, create a function declaration and a code block.</li>
          <li>A function declaration contains the function keyword and the function name followed by parentheses.</li>
          <li>A code block is surrounded by curly brackets and lists out the instructions for the function using console.log statements.</li>
          <li>To call a function, list the name of the function where the code will be executed.</li>
          <li>Math.floor() and Math.random() are properties that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
